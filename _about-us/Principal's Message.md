In East Spring Primary, we believe in providing a Positive and Caring environment to develop every E’Light into Lifelong Learners and Gracious Individuals. The focus of our ESPS curriculum is to provide a balanced emphasis on the cognitive academic pursuit and the development of 21st Century Competencies.&nbsp;

The school’s programs are geared to develop E’Lights with knowledge, skills and dispositions that will equip them for current and future learning. Some of our signature programmes includes our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) which develops problem solving skills through Design Thinking and Coding Skills across their 6 years in ESPS. Other than the ALP, we also have our Lifelong Learning Programme which focus on the development of Social Emotional Skills through our Outdoor Education Syllabus in the middle and upper primary.

As part of the ECO-Stewardship Programme (ESP), our students are educated and involved in environmental sustainability projects such as urban farming in our greenhouses and hydroponic systems where their vegetable harvest is then shared with the Tampines-Changkat Community Fridge project for the needy in the community as part of our care for the environment and community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

With the introduction of ‘SHINE &amp; SPARKLE’ in ESPS, we hope to empower our E’Light with Positive strategies that they can use for self-care and care for others. We are currently embarking on the use of Character Strengths to better support student development in the school. &nbsp;

East Spring is dynamic learning community and we look forward to your participation and partnership in flourishing our E’Lights. 


Sincerely<br>
Mr. Wong Kin Mun<br>
Principal
