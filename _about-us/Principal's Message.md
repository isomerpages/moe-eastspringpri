<p>At East Spring Primary School, we prepare our students for the challenges
and opportunities of an increasingly complex, globalised world. Our aim
is to equip them with essential 21st-century skills and competencies, firmly
grounded in sound values and a passion for lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Our curriculum strikes a careful balance between rigorous academic pursuits
and the development of crucial life skills. We nurture well-rounded individuals,
celebrating each child's uniqueness and potential. Our school vision, 'Gracious
School, Life-long Learners', remains relevant in our dynamic world:</p>
<p>• 'Gracious School' embodies a community that fosters kindness, respect,
and empathy, cultivating well-mannered individuals who treat others with
consideration.</p>
<p>• 'Life-long Learners' reflects our commitment to instilling persistent
curiosity and a thirst for knowledge that extends beyond the classroom,
empowering students to take ownership of their learning journey.</p>
<p>We offer enriching experiences through our signature programmes:</p>
<p>1. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) develops critical problem-solving
skills through Design Thinking and Coding.</p>
<p>2. The Learning for Life Programme enhances social-emotional competencies
through Outdoor Education.</p>
<p>3. Our Eco-stewardship Initiative cultivates environmental consciousness
through hands-on projects and community engagement.</p>
<p>These programmes help students uncover their talents and interests in
a nurturing environment where every child feels valued and inspired to
'SHINE &amp; SPARKLE'.</p>
<p>We believe that education is a collaborative partnership between school
and home. We encourage open communication and active parental involvement
whilst maintaining professional boundaries that allow our teachers to exercise
their expertise effectively. For instance, whilst we welcome parental input,
we ask that parents trust our teachers' decisions on matters such as curriculum
delivery, classroom management, and assessment methods.</p>
<p>Together, we can inspire our students to realise their aspirations and
prepare them not just for academic success, but for life's diverse challenges
and opportunities. We look forward to embarking on this exciting journey
of discovery and growth with you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>Mdm Neo Lay Wah
<br>Principal</p>
