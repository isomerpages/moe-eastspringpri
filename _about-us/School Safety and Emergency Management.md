<p><strong>School Security</strong>
</p>
<p>All visitors must register at the security post before entering the school.
Please wear the provided sticker or access lanyard for identification purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Road Safety</strong>
</p>
<p>We seek your continual support to exercise care and consideration in making
the roads safe and traffic smooth in/around the school vicinity.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>a)&nbsp; Vehicle Drop off and Pick Up Zone at Gate C, Tampines Street 33</strong>
</p>

</div>
<p>Use designated vehicle drop-off and pick-up at Gate C only. Avoid stopping
in unauthorized zones such as along Tampines Street 31 as it may cause
traffic congestion along the road.</p>
<p>Please avoid arriving earlier than the scheduled school dismissal time.
Do use designated parking spaces at nearby HDB carparks if you are early.</p>
<p>LTA will take enforcement actions against vehicles found parking indiscriminately
and causing inconvenience to others.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driving Into School</strong>
</p>
<p>If you are driving into the school, please adhere to vehicle speed of
15km/h when within the school’s premises, stay alert for pedestrians and
cooperate with traffic marshals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please inform our security officers if you are driving in to pick up your
unwell child/ward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it rains during school arrival time, you are allowed to drive into
the school foyer to alight your&nbsp; child/ward.&nbsp; Please ensure your
child/ward is ready to alight when approaching the gate.&nbsp; Do drop
off your child/ward in an orderly manner and drive off immediately after
doing so to prevent congestion at the school’s roundabout.</p>
<p>You may drive in to pick up your child once the school gates open after
1:50 PM. This will be a pick-and-go arrangement, and vehicles are not permitted
to wait on school premises.</p>

<p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe Route to School</strong>
</p>

</div>
<p>If your child/ward walks or cycles to school from Block 358, please advise
him/her to use the traffic junction in front of Block 357 to cross over
to the school for their safety, as the traffic junction is supervised by
a teacher from 7.15 am to 7.30 am.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Safe Cycling</strong>
</p>
<p>With many of our students choosing to cycle to and from school, it is
essential that they are equipped with the necessary knowledge for safe
cycling. As part of our ongoing commitment to road safety education, we
work in partnership with parents to promote road safety awareness and instill
proper road safety behavior in their children.</p>
<p>To ensure all student cyclists are well-informed, they are required to
complete a road safety quiz on the SLS platform.</p>
<p>Key Points for Safe Cycling:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure that the bicycle is in good working
condition before cycling. Bicycles should ideally be fitted with front
and rear lights and a bell. The bicycle’s brakes, chains, tires, lights
and bell should be well-maintained and in good working order.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wear protective gears, such as a helmet,
proper shoes (if there are shoelaces, they should be properly tied), elbow
and knee pads to protect against injuries.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refrain from using mobile phone, even
with an in-ear attachment or listen to music through earphones while cycling.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure the bicycle at the bicycle racks
located in the school premises with a lock.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Emergency Management</strong>
</p>
<p>The school has established procedures to respond to emergencies, taking
measures appropriate to the severity and scope of each situation. Annual
emergency exercises are conducted to ensure our staff and students are
well-prepared with the necessary knowledge and skills to handle emergencies.</p>

<p><strong>Notification on the Use of Pictures and Videos</strong>

<p>We would like to inform you that photos or video images of your child/ward
may be captured during school programmes and events. From time to time,

website, social media, feature walls and publications.</p>

photographs and videos on these platforms. If you do not wish to have your
