_Let us learn, grow and excel_


_Let us love, care and share_

_As we build a bright future with knowledge and values we have_

_East Spring is where we are from_

_East Spring is where our loy'lty lies_

_We pledge to give our best with pride in all our work_

_Let us stand in unity, spirit, mind and body,_

_with love for our school and country_

_Excellence for success_

_East Spring is where we are from_

_East Spring is where our loy'lty lies_

_We pledge to give our best with pride in all our work_

_
