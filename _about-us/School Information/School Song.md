<p><em>Let us learn, grow and excel</em>
<br><em>Let us love, care and share</em>
<br><em>As we build a bright future with knowledge and values we have</em>
</p>
<p><em>East Spring is where we are from</em>
<br><em>East Spring is where our loy'lty lies</em>
<br><em>We pledge to give our best with pride in all our work</em>
</p>
<p><em>Let us stand in unity, spirit, mind and body,</em>
<br><em>with love for our school and country</em>
<br><em>Excellence for success</em>
</p>
<p><em>East Spring is where we are from</em>
<br><em>East Spring is where our loy'lty lies</em>
<br><em>We pledge to give our best with pride in all our work</em>
</p>
<p>Composed by Mr Goh Say Meng
