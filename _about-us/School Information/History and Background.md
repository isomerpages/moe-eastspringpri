Established on 4 January 1999, East Spring Primary School was built as a government school to serve the neighborhood of the eastern sector of Tampines New Town.

  

The school started with 400 pupils in 10 Primary One classes and a staff of 15 teachers at a holding school in Qiaonan Primary for the first 3 months. It then moved to the new premises on 22 March 1999.

Dr Aline Wong, then Senior Minister of State for Education and Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC officially opened the school on the 3 August 2001.

The school strongly upholds pupils' holistic education with its vibrant programs and initiatives that centre around character building as fundamental to the development of an educated individual.

The school culture promotes innovation and creativity. Pupils and teachers are constantly challenged to question the norms and find new and better ways of doing things. This innovative and creative culture is aligned to the vision of 'Thinking Schools, Learning Nation' and it drives the school to become a learning organization that is constantly improving its processes to ensure that East Spring Primary School offers its pupils an education of the highest quality.

The school once had the privilege of hosting the Zone's Centre of Excellence for Science, known as the Science Exploria in 2003. Currently, it is the Centre of Learning in Science as it collaborates with schools in the East Zone to provide a wide range of activities and programs for pupils and teachers.

Selected as one of the ten schools to be in the pilot Flexible Infrastructure (FlexSI) Scheme in 2006, the school has transformed its physical and learning landscape. Through this scheme, the school redefined its learning areas to include two projects: a Multi-disciplinary Learning Trail (Spring Trail) and a Multi-Use Canteen (Spring Hub). The enhanced environment has facilitated the school's emphasis on experiential learning through providing engaging learning activities and learning experiences beyond the textbook and classrooms.

The school now looks forward to new developments as we have been selected for the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) upgrade which promises new facilities such as a dance studio, performing arts studio and an indoor sports hall. The school has indeed come a long way to becoming the prestigious and established school that it is now.
