<p>The Mathematics Department programmes are designed to develop students’
problem-solving skills and promote critical thinking. They aim to cultivate
a strong foundation in mathematics by equipping students with the essential
skills and strategies needed for lifelong learning and real-world application.</p>
<p>The programmes enable students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and
continued learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive
skills through a problem-solving approach;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build confidence and foster a sustained interest in Mathematics;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Our Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Mathematics &amp; Science Discovery Fortnight (MSDF)</strong>
</p>
<p>To ignite curiosity and cultivate a passion for learning, engaging activities
and friendly competitions are organised for our students. These experiences
provide opportunities for them to apply their Mathematical and Science
knowledge in real-life situations, deepening their understanding and appreciation
of both subjects.
<br>Across all levels from Primary 1 to Primary 6, students take part in a
vibrant array of hands-on activities that encourage exploration and discovery.
During recess, they engage in purposeful educational play that strengthens
their factual fluency, enhances visualisation skills and develops logical
thinking — all while having fun.
