We believe in nurturing a culture of care where teachers can teach and our E’Lights learn in a safe, orderly and caring environment. We aim to develop programmes, practices and processes to enhance the school experience of every E’Lights. Through a developmental approach, we hope to cultivate character, deepen values and SEL competencies in order to provide quality-learning experiences for our students in their journey towards Flourishing E’Lights..</p><p>To enhance every E’Light’s educational journey, the department oversees student well-being and peer support, the Student Leadership Programme, Student Management and Discipline. We hope to see them SHINE &amp; SPARKLE at the end of their journey with us!</p><blockquote><h4>“Let us prepare every child for the test of life, and not just a life of tests.”<br></h4></blockquote><p></p><ul><li><p>School Values</p></li></ul><p>The core values for the school reflect what we desire E’Lights to internalise. “The core values (Self-Control, Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity, National Pride, Gratefulness) are fundamental for a person of good character and a useful citizen of Singapore. They guide students to discern between right and wrong, help them to make responsible choices and become more aware of their roles in society.”</p><p><br></p><p></p><ul><li><p>Let’s SPRING&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Let us SPRING to the New Year by having fun with our teachers and classmates!

These are important for our E’Lights in their journey as life-long learners.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the learning dispositions which we strive for our students to acquire.</p><p><br></p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Learning Dispositions</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Descriptors</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Joy of Learning</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul><li><p>I will show passion in my learning by enjoying the lesson.</p></li><li><p>I will participate actively during class discussion.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Enthusiasm</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul><li><p>I will show interest during lessons.</p></li><li><p>I will ask questions and clarify my doubts.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Diligence</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul><li><p>I will focus my energy towards my learning.</p></li><li><p>I will be responsible and check my work for accuracy.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Resilience and Grit</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul><li><p>I will display self-control&nbsp; and stay on task (persevere) no matter how difficult it is.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I will not give up even if the assignments are difficult.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Open-mindedness</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><ul><li><p>I will seek and explore new ideas and solutions.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I will act on feedback and work on it.</p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
