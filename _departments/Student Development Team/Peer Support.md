<ul><li><p><strong>Peer Support&nbsp;</strong></p></li></ul><p>We promote a caring and enabling school environment with a prosocial and supportive peer support culture. We equip our Eâ€™Lights with peer support knowledge and skills for promoting cyber wellness and prosocial behaviour through CCE lessons and student development experiences. The Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) in each class help the teachers to support the students in class. The Peer Support Relationship (PSR) efforts and training of PSLs, act as a key lever to positively influence and support students involved in hurtful behaviour, bullying, and cyber issues.&nbsp;</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SDT/Peer_Support.jpg"></div><p></p><p>Projects under the care of PSLs to promote peer support in the class:</p><p><br></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SDT/Gratitude_Jar_P1_to_P6.jpg"></div><p><br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SDT/Peer_Support_Help_Box_P3_to_P6.png"></div><p><br><br><br></p>
