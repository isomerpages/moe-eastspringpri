<p><strong>Student Development Team (SDT)</strong>
</p>
<p>The SDT oversees the character development and holistic learning experiences
of the students. We believe in nurturing a culture of care where teachers
can teach and our E’Lights learn in a safe, orderly and caring environment.
We aim to develop programmes, practices and processes to enhance the school
experience of every E’Lights. Through a developmental approach, we hope
to cultivate character, deepen values and SEL competencies in order to
provide quality-learning experiences for our students in their journey
towards Flourishing E’Lights..</p>
<p>To enhance every E’Light’s educational journey, the department oversees
student well-being and peer support, the Student Leadership Programme,
Student Management and Discipline. We hope to see them SHINE &amp; SPARKLE
at the end of their journey with us!</p>

<p>“Let us prepare every child for the test of life, and not just a life
of tests.”</p>

<p><strong>School Values</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The core values for the school reflect what we desire E’Lights to internalise.
“The core values (Self-Control, Perseverance, Responsibility, Integrity,
National Pride, Gratefulness) are fundamental for a person of good character
and a useful citizen of Singapore. They guide students to discern between
right and wrong, help them to make responsible choices and become more
aware of their roles in society.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Learning Dispositions</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning dispositions sometimes called 'habits of mind' or 'dispositions
to learning' are positive behaviours and attitudes towards learning. These
are important for our E’Lights in their journey as life-long learners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These are the learning dispositions which we strive for our students to
acquire.</p>

<p><strong>Social Skills</strong>

<p>The students are taught Social Skills so that they are able to interact
with one another in ways that are socially acceptable, as well as personally
or mutually beneficial, or beneficial to others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The skills are taught explicitly to all based on their’ needs and matching
the skills complexity with the students’ ability level. They learn the
social skills and apply them through various platforms such as LLP camps
and CCAs.</p>
