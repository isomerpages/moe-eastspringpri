<ul><li><p><strong>Student Management &amp; Discipline</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong><u>Discipline Objective (Our Discipline Policy)</u></strong></p><p></p><p>At East Spring Primary School,<strong> </strong>our aim is to develop our students into individuals with good self-discipline so that they can create a conducive learning environment for them and their peers. <strong>We believe that students learn well when there is order and discipline</strong>. At the same time, we believe that students need care, encouragement and space to learn from their mistakes and make improvements in their conduct.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>In line with our plans to move towards positive education, we follow MOE's guidelines closely towards a more positive and proactive approach to discipline.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SDT/Student_management_Discipline.jpg"></div><p>We strongly believe in the importance of the home-school partnership and working closely and collaboratively with parents and guardians in order to achieve the best outcomes for our students. We maintain close communication and proactively engage parents and guardians regarding any inappropriate behaviour for them to understand the situation better so that we can work together to guide and support our students.</p><p></p><p>We take a whole-school approach to discipline and articulate explicitly to our students the school rules and expectations at the start of every academic year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Please refer to the Student Handbook on what is expected of our students.</strong></p><ul><li><p>School Rules</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Attire</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>School Uniform</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SDT/School_uniform.jpg"></div><p><strong>PE Attire (Boys &amp; Girls)</strong><br><br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SDT/PE_attire.jpg"></div><p><strong>Shoes and Socks (Boys &amp; Girls)</strong><br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/SDT/Shoes_and_Socks.jpg"></div><p></p><ul><li><p><strong>Punctuality and Attendance</strong></p></li></ul><ol><li><p>Attendance is <u>compulsory</u> for all school activities unless students are unwell.</p></li><li><p>Absence from school must be supported with a <strong>valid medical certificate</strong> from a qualified doctor or a letter with valid reason(s) from parents/ guardians. <strong>Only 5 letters from parents/guardians are accepted per semester.</strong></p></li><li><p>Punctuality is to be observed at all times.
