The Student Management Department believes in nurturing a culture of care where teachers can teach and students learn in a safe, orderly and caring environment. Good behaviour and effective behavioural management strategies maximise the opportunities of every child to develop to their fullest potential. To enhance every E’Light’s educational journey, the department oversees the Student Leadership Programme, Discipline and Behavioural Management through a multitude of structured platforms.

  

Under Student Leadership, we believe that: **Every Child Is A Leader** and we aim to equip students with leadership skills and competencies by effectively implementing training and staging opportunities for students to reinforce this knowledge at the class, CCA or school platform.

There are 3 tiers of Student Leaders in the school. Tier 1 will be the most basic level whereby E’Lights are able to lead themselves. This is in alignment with the general behaviour when they are in school. E’Lights are generally punctual for school and attend classes regularly, polite and respectful towards teachers and peers, honest and truthful in words and actions amongst others. These behavioural outcomes of students are expected of all E’Lights hence leading to a Conduct Grade of ‘Good’.

  

Tier 2 students will include the next group of Class Leaders, P2, P3 & P4 Prefects and CCA Leaders. These group of students are at the lowest rung of the Student Leaders whereby they are trained in self-management and relationship management competencies.

  

In Tier 3, these include the P5 CCA Leaders, Prefects, P6 CCA Leaders, Prefects and Prefects EXCO. These group of student leaders will have a greater scope of contribution to the school hence their leadership competencies include mentoring and empowerment.

  

The department looks into the various training programmes for all Student Leaders which includes The Prefects’ Investiture. Together with the Year Heads and Assistant Year Head, the department looks into the effectiveness of the training progammes, contributions to the various school programmes, their leadership competency evaluation and the recognition which the school provides for them.

  

**Students learn well when there is order and discipline**. At the same time, they need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and improve. A judicious balance creates an environment conducive for their learning and development. A positive, proactive approach to discipline develops students’ readiness and motivation to learn, and enables them to feel safe both physically and psychologically.

  

**Discipline is an educative process, and the goal is to instil self-discipline and good character in students. Disciplinary measures serve as a proxy for consequences of the poor choices made**. It is not punishment, and will be meted out fairly, firmly, and appropriately.

  

The department also looks into the overall safety of all students in the school. Talks are conducted to remind students of safety in and outside school. Every Primary 4 student is engaged in The Road Safety Games at the Road Safety Park.
