<p><strong>Department Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>The Science department programmes are designed to develop our students’
curiosity and passion for Science. Through these programmes, we hope to
provide our students with the opportunities to apply concepts and skills
to their daily lives and in the process, instil in our students the spirit
of scientific inquiry. Our Science programmes also serve to inculcate in
our students a sense of responsibility in caring for our environment. Our
programmes include:</p>
<p>• <strong>Mathematics &amp; Science Discovery Fortnight</strong>
</p>
<p>Through this fortnight programme, P3-P6 students participate in a string
of activities lined up for them to explore and learn Science concepts.
These include hands-on activities to engage students during recess to learn
through exploration and educational play.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Science Teaching Around STELLAR (STarS) for Primary 1 and 2</strong>
</p>
<p>Science teaching is infused into STELLAR lesson through STarS to enable
younger students at P1 and P2 to experience science at an earlier age.
For example, students read the story “A butterfly is born” and observe
the life cycle of a real butterfly provided for each group. Students have
an opportunity to observe how the caterpillars develop into butterflies.
In caring for these caterpillars, students learn the importance of food
to these living things. When these caterpillars emerge as butterflies,
students have the joy to release them back to the nature to allow the life-cycle
to continue.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>ESPS Every child a seed</strong> (<em>in partnership with NParks</em>)</p>
<p>Through this programme, the Primary 3 students are each given a plant
starter kit from NParks. These kits allow each student to grow seedlings
on their own to learn about the life cycle of plants and the parts of a
plant. Students can transfer their seedlings and continue to nurture them
in the school allocated garden plots to extend their learning and be responsible
and caring individuals.</p>

</p>
<p>Selected students who demonstrate interest and ability in Science will
be introduced to E2k &nbsp;enrichment programme that include scientific
investigations and given opportunities to develop critical and inventive
thinking and effective communication skills.</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Young Science Badge Scheme</strong>
</p>
<p>To enhance Science learning in and out of the classroom, Young Scientist
Badge Scheme (YSBS) is now sponsored by MOE for all Primary 3 to Primary
6 students. Students may explore these badges through the Young Scientist
site or through the Student Learning Space (SLS). To better guide our students,
we have assigned the following cards to the respective levels.</p>
<p>P3: I am a Young Zoologist
<br>P4: I am a Young Physicist</p>
<p>* Students who wished to complete more cards after completing the above
tasks are free to do so.</p>
