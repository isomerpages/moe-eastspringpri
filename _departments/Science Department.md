<p><strong>Department Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>The Science department programmes are designed to develop our students’
curiosity and passion for Science. Through these programmes, we hope to
provide our students with the opportunities to apply concepts and skills
to their daily lives and in the process, instil in our students the spirit
of scientific inquiry. Our Science programmes also serve to inculcate in
our students a sense of responsibility in caring for our environment. Our
programmes include:</p>
<p>• <strong>Mathematics &amp; Science Discovery Fortnight</strong>
</p>
<p>Through this fortnight programme, P3-P6 students participate in a string
of activities lined up for them to explore and learn Science concepts.
These include hands-on activities to engage students during recess to learn
through exploration and educational play.</p>
