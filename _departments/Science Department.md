Our Programmes
--------------

The Science department programmes are designed to develop our students’ curiosity and passion for Science. Through these programmes, we hope to provide our students with the opportunities to apply concepts and skills to their daily lives and in the process, instil in our students the spirit of scientific inquiry. Our Science programmes also serve to inculcate in our students a sense of responsibility in caring for our environment. Our programmes include:

*   **Science Discovery Week**

Through this week-long programme, P1-P6 students participate in a string of activities lined up for them to explore and learn Science concepts. These include hands-on activities to engage students during recess to learn through exploration and educational play. There is also special assembly programme organised to allow spark off curiosity and interest in science.
