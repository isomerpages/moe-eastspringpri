    <div>  
      <p>In our school, CCE is integrated with both Instructional Programmes (IP) as well as the Non-Instructional programmes (non-IP), co-curricular programmes, CCA, Values-In-Action (VIA), Student Leadership Development and other school programmes. In this way, CCE is part and parcel of the school experience of our students. Through CCE, our school aims to nurture gracious E’Lights who are morally upright and concerned citizens. This is achieved by inculcating values and building SE competencies in our students. This in turn will develop them into persons of good character and concerned citizens in our rapidly changing and globalised world. We believe that every student should have an equal opportunity to develop his/her potential. We aim to achieve this by, not only offering a balanced, holistic curriculum that challenges students, but also by providing care, support and guidance to each and every student. The department focuses on Character Education, which is one of the main pillars of the school curriculum. Character Education in East Spring anchors on the six SPRING values. With a team of experienced, caring and enthusiastic teaching as well as non-teaching staff, we aspire to meet the needs of each pupil with the hope of building a lasting relationship grounded upon the values of respect, optimism, care and mutual trust.</p>  
			<p>Pastoral Care</p>
			<p>The students’ well-being is well-looked into through the provision of guidance and counselling programmes. The school believes in building quality relationship between the staff and students. Through the Student Interaction Time (SIT) programme, teachers spend time talking with their students, in an effort to get to know them better. Other programmes that look into the development of social-emotional learning competencies include the Sexuality Education (P5 & 6), Cyber-wellness programmes, Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and Educational Career Guidance (ECG).</p>

			<p>National Education / Social Studies</p>
			<p>NE aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our pupils confidence in our nation's future. It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore. National Education is pervasively implemented through Social Studies lessons, Learning Journeys, NE Commemorative Events and CCAs.</p>

			<p>Values-In-Action Programme</p>
			<p>Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme is one of the key programmes that has been put in place to inculcate values and build competencies in our students to develop them into good individuals and useful citizens. It forms part of the school’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) which has always been at the heart of education in Singapore. The programme aims to strengthen the school’s commitment in civic and moral responsibility towards the community. It further supports the school’s mission in nurturing caring citizens and building strong character in our students. The following are some of the programmes that the school has planned for the students:</p>
			<p>Donation Drives</p>
			<p>The school collaborates with the Compassion Fund, an organization formed to help students whose next-of-kins may have experienced financial difficulty due to health or other unforeseen adversities. In our annual collections done in Semester 1, students and staff gave outright donations.</p>
			<p>The school also collaborates with the organization, Fairprice, in a food donation drive, Walk for Rice. The food donated would reach out to the less privileged individual and families in the community through a food distribution programme. Through this project, the school hopes to instil in the students the values of ‘Caring and Sharing’ and develop them into gracious E’Lights  </p>
			<p>Taking Care of Our Environment</p>
			<p>In support of the ‘Green Efforts’, the school makes a concerted effort to ensure that the environment is clean and conducive for learning. The school conducts the ‘Use Your Hands Day’ cleaning programme twice a year. Students do their part to ensure that the areas assigned to them are kept clean. Students bring their rags and cleaning cloths from home and together as a class, do their part to ensure that the school environment is clean and conducive. In class, teachers reinforce the values that the students will learn through this experience.</p>

			<p>All students are involved in the school-wide cleaning up programme - ‘Clean Up Time!’ which is carried out during the first five minutes of their recess. In addition, all Primary 4 to Primary 6 students are involved in the maintenance of the cleanliness of the canteen once a week after recess.</p>  
			<p>Celebrating with the Elderly</p>  
			<p>Annually, the school invites the grandparents of P1-P3 students to join us in the joyous celebration of Chinese New Year. These elderly folks join the school in the concert were presented with oranges as a gesture of goodwill.  </p>
			<p>VIA@ St Luke’s</p>  
			<p>As part of their VIA programme, Primary Five students and teachers visit St Luke’s Eldercare Centre and engage the elderly in a number of activities such as Sing-a-long, Art and Craft work and the making of plant terrarium project.</p>
