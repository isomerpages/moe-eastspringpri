<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Our Programmes</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our school, CCE is integrated with both Instructional Programmes (IP)
as well as the Non-Instructional programmes (non-IP), co-curricular programmes,
CCA, Values-In-Action (VIA), Student Leadership Development and other school
programmes. In this way, CCE is part and parcel of the school experience
of our students. Through CCE, our school aims to nurture gracious E’Lights
who are morally upright and concerned citizens. This is achieved by inculcating
values and building SE competencies in our students. This in turn will
develop them into persons of good character and concerned citizens in our
rapidly changing and globalised world. We believe that every student should
have an equal opportunity to develop his/her potential. We aim to achieve
this by, not only offering a balanced, holistic curriculum that challenges
students, but also by providing care, support and guidance to each and
every student. The department focuses on Character Education, which is
one of the main pillars of the school curriculum. Character Education in
East Spring anchors on the six SPRING values. With a team of experienced,
caring and enthusiastic teaching as well as non-teaching staff, we aspire
to meet the needs of each pupil with the hope of building a lasting relationship
grounded upon the values of respect, optimism, care and mutual trust.</p>
<p><strong>Pastoral Care</strong>
</p>
<p>The students’ well-being is well-looked into through the provision of
guidance and counselling programmes. The school believes in building quality
relationship between the staff and students. Through the Student Interaction
Time (SIT) programme, teachers spend time talking with their students,
in an effort to get to know them better. Other programmes that look into
the development of social-emotional learning competencies include the Sexuality
Education (P5 &amp; 6), Cyber-wellness programmes, Form Teacher Guidance
Period (FTGP) and Educational Career Guidance (ECG).</p>

<p><strong>National Education / Social Studies</strong>
</p>
<p>NE aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival
as a nation and instil in our pupils confidence in our nation's future.
It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness
to Singapore. National Education is pervasively implemented through Social
Studies lessons, Learning Journeys, NE Commemorative Events and CCAs.</p>

<p><strong>Values-In-Action Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme is one of the key programmes that has
been put in place to inculcate values and build competencies in our students
to develop them into good individuals and useful citizens. It forms part
of the school’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) which has always
been at the heart of education in Singapore. The programme aims to strengthen
the school’s commitment in civic and moral responsibility towards the community.
It further supports the school’s mission in nurturing caring citizens and
building strong character in our students. The following are some of the
programmes that the school has planned for the students:</p>
<p><strong>Donation Drives</strong>
</p>
<p>The school collaborates with the Compassion Fund, an organization formed
to help students whose next-of-kins may have experienced financial difficulty
due to health or other unforeseen adversities. In our annual collections
done in Semester 1, students and staff gave outright donations.</p>
<p>The school also collaborates with the organization, Fairprice, in a food
donation drive, Walk for Rice. The food donated would reach out to the
less privileged individual and families in the community through a food
distribution programme. Through this project, the school hopes to instil
in the students the values of ‘Caring and Sharing’ and develop them into
gracious E’Lights</p>
<p><strong>Taking Care of Our Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>In support of the ‘Green Efforts’, the school makes a concerted effort
to ensure that the environment is clean and conducive for learning. The
school conducts the ‘Use Your Hands Day’ cleaning programme twice a year.
Students do their part to ensure that the areas assigned to them are kept
clean. Students bring their rags and cleaning cloths from home and together
as a class, do their part to ensure that the school environment is clean
and conducive. In class, teachers reinforce the values that the students
will learn through this experience.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/cce5.png">
</div>
<p>All students are involved in the school-wide cleaning up programme - ‘Clean
Up Time!’ which is carried out during the first five minutes of their recess.
In addition, all Primary 4 to Primary 6 students are involved in the maintenance
of the cleanliness of the canteen once a week after recess.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrating with the Elderly</strong>
</p>
<p>Annually, the school invites the grandparents of P1-P3 students to join
us in the joyous celebration of Chinese New Year. These elderly folks join
the school in the concert were presented with oranges as a gesture of goodwill.</p>
<p><strong>VIA@ St Luke’s</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of their VIA programme, Primary Five students and teachers visit
St Luke’s Eldercare Centre and engage the elderly in a number of activities
such as Sing-a-long, Art and Craft work and the making of plant terrarium
project.</p>

<p><strong>Community Outreach</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2018, the P6 students started a community outreach programme, whereby
they presented festive gifts (oranges, dates and murukku) to the residents
in the neighbourhood during the main festive celebrations.</p>

<p>· Overview of East Spring Primary School's Sexuality Education Programme
2024</p>
<p>·&nbsp; Information For Parents</p>
<p><strong>MOE’s Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to
understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those
with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the
family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2. The goals of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;i.&nbsp; To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions
through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;on
human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p>
<p>ii. To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships
through the acquisition of&nbsp;social and emotional skills&nbsp;of self-awareness,
management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy
for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and
decision-making skills; and</p>
<p>iii. To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves
and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit
of society, through the inculcation of&nbsp;positive mainstream values
and attitudes&nbsp;about sexuality.</p>
<p>3. The key messages of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>i. Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>ii. Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>iii. Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>iv. Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p>Overview of East Spring Primary School's Sexuality Education Programme
for 2022</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through
the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into
five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual
Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click&nbsp;

in the school curriculum.</p>
<p>5. The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a. Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;Science</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;Health Education</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p>Growing Years (GY) Programme: "Curious Minds (2nd Edition)" (Primary 5
&amp; 6) Teaching &amp; Learning resource package</p>
<p>6. The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, Children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. “Curious
Minds” is a response to these challenges.</p>
<p>7. The Primary 5 &amp; 6 Growing Years (GY) package, “Curious Minds (2nd
Edition)”, aims to meet students’ developmental needs, give emphasis to
the teaching of skills and values, and focus on helping students navigate
changes, build healthy relationships, especially online relationships,
and exercise safety. At East Spring Primary School, the following lessons
from the Growing Years Programme for Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils will
be taught in 2024:</p>
