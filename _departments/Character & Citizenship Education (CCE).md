<ul><li><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Our Programmes</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In our school, CCE is integrated with both Instructional Programmes (IP) as well as the Non-Instructional programmes (non-IP), co-curricular programmes, CCA, Values-In-Action (VIA), Student Leadership Development and other school programmes. In this way, CCE is part and parcel of the school experience of our students. Through CCE, our school aims to nurture gracious E’Lights who are morally upright and concerned citizens. This is achieved by inculcating values and building SE competencies in our students. This in turn will develop them into persons of good character and concerned citizens in our rapidly changing and globalised world. We believe that every student should have an equal opportunity to develop his/her potential. We aim to achieve this by, not only offering a balanced, holistic curriculum that challenges students, but also by providing care, support and guidance to each and every student. The department focuses on Character Education, which is one of the main pillars of the school curriculum. Character Education in East Spring anchors on the six SPRING values. With a team of experienced, caring and enthusiastic teaching as well as non-teaching staff, we aspire to meet the needs of each pupil with the hope of building a lasting relationship grounded upon the values of respect, optimism, care and mutual trust.</p><p><strong>Pastoral Care</strong></p><p>The students’ well-being is well-looked into through the provision of guidance and counselling programmes. The school believes in building quality relationship between the staff and students. Through the Student Interaction Time (SIT) programme, teachers spend time talking with their students, in an effort to get to know them better. Other programmes that look into the development of social-emotional learning competencies include the Sexuality Education (P5 &amp; 6), Cyber-wellness programmes, Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and Educational Career Guidance (ECG).</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/cce.png"></div><p><strong>National Education / Social Studies</strong></p><p>NE aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our pupils confidence in our nation's future.

It forms part of the school’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) which has always been at the heart of education in Singapore. The programme aims to strengthen the school’s commitment in civic and moral responsibility towards the community. It further supports the school’s mission in nurturing caring citizens and building strong character in our students. The following are some of the programmes that the school has planned for the students:</p><p><strong>Donation Drives</strong></p><p>The school collaborates with the Compassion Fund, an organization formed to help students whose next-of-kins may have experienced financial difficulty due to health or other unforeseen adversities. In our annual collections done in Semester 1, students and staff gave outright donations.</p><p>The school also collaborates with the organization, Fairprice, in a food donation drive, Walk for Rice. The food donated would reach out to the less privileged individual and families in the community through a food distribution programme. Through this project, the school hopes to instil in the students the values of ‘Caring and Sharing’ and develop them into gracious E’Lights</p><p><strong>Taking Care of Our Environment</strong></p><p>In support of the ‘Green Efforts’, the school makes a concerted effort to ensure that the environment is clean and conducive for learning. The school conducts the ‘Use Your Hands Day’ cleaning programme twice a year. Students do their part to ensure that the areas assigned to them are kept clean. Students bring their rags and cleaning cloths from home and together as a class, do their part to ensure that the school environment is clean and conducive. In class, teachers reinforce the values that the students will learn through this experience.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/cce5.png"></div><p>All students are involved in the school-wide cleaning up programme - ‘Clean Up Time!’ which is carried out during the first five minutes of their recess.

Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p><p>2. The goals of Sexuality Education are:</p><p>&nbsp;i.&nbsp; To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;</p><p>ii. To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of&nbsp;social and emotional skills&nbsp;of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and</p><p>iii. To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of&nbsp;positive mainstream values and attitudes&nbsp;about sexuality.</p><p>3. The key messages of Sexuality Education are:</p><p>i. Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p><p>ii. Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);</p><p>iii. Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and</p><p>iv. Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies.

The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Growing Years Series (GYS) a response to these challenges.</p><p>7. The Primary 5 &amp; 6 Growing Years (GY) package, “Curious Minds (2nd Edition)”, aims to meet students’ developmental needs, give emphasis to the teaching of skills and values, and focus on helping students navigate&nbsp;changes, build healthy&nbsp;relationships, especially online relationships, and exercise&nbsp;safety.</p><p>At EAST SPRING Primary School, the following lessons from the Growing Years Programme for Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils will be taught in 2022</p><p><strong>Primary 5</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sexed.png"></div><p><strong>Primary 6</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/sexed2.png"></div><p><strong>Information For Parents</strong></p><p><br></p><p>8.&nbsp;Parents may opt their children out of the Growing Years programme, and/or supplementary sexuality education programmes by MOE-approved external providers.</p><p>9.&nbsp;Parents who wish to opt their children out of the&nbsp;Growing Years (GY) programme&nbsp;need to complete an opt-out form.
