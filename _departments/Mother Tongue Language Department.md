While students participate in the programme, it is also essential that they document their reflections for the cultural learning. A customized file entitled ‘My Cultural Journey’ to allow students to document their learning and experience is given to accompany the students in their learning journey.

Last but not least, in this ‘My Cultural Journey’, students get to collect a set of collectible customised magnets, unique to E’Lights in the respective cultural themes, after they have completed the level-designated activity at the end of each of their six years in East Spring Primary

As part of MOE’s focus on a Student-Centric, Values-Driven Education, MTL Department strongly believes that while we build up students’ foundation and strength in academic learning, we also need to provide invaluable lessons and learning experiences to help students internalise and practise good values and skills, and develop competencies that are critical to character and citizenship development of our students.

The Cultural Exposure series set out to educate our students in the different aspects of traditional wedding custom and traditions by the three races. It serves to expose students to the intricate details of a wedding preparation and the customs behind that set the stage of a traditional wedding, such as betrothal, dowry, bed setting etc.

Authentic setting gives students a tangible feel of the celebration and students also participated in tasting of traditional wedding cakes and parts of the wedding ceremony activities.
