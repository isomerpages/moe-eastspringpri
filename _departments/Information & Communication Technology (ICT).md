Our Programmes & Use of ICT Tools in Lessons
--------------------------------------------

*   **Mobile Learning with iPads**

iPADs are not just a cool toy but rather a powerful tool that is virtually changing the face of education. With more than 15 000 education apps available, teachers and students alike are having no trouble finding content and material for learning. In East Spring, our students will be involved in Learning Trails around the school compound. Outdoor learning is now made more fun and engaging for the students.
