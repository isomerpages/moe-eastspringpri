Our Programmes
--------------

*   **Fitness & Conditioning Programme**

To imbue in E’Lights the mindset of healthy living and to build good habits in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, the school introduces Modular PE (Athletics) for Primary 4 to Primary 6 weekly. Additionally, the school also has the Fitness and Conditioning Programme for Primary 2 to Primary 5 E’Lights. This is a two-prong approach in catering to E’Lights with BMI above the acceptable range as well as selected Sports CCA Leaders. The main purpose of the programme is to empower E’Lights with high BMI to take ownership of their health and fitness, and importantly to put in practice the value of resilience and self-control. At the same time, the Sports CCA Leaders will join the programme to further develop their fitness and conditioning for improved performance and to stretch their aptitude in their CCA. In this programme, E’Lights will also get to apply the skills which they have learnt from their PE lessons into games which they will be engaged in like Basketball, Football, etc. Also, they will perform fitness circuits targeting body parts through a variety of chosen physical activities
