Some tips to doing well for assessment

  
The assessment objectives of the syllabus are aligned to the three domains in the curriculum framework as shown below:

1.  Assessment of Knowledge, Understanding and Application of Science Concepts
2.  Assessment of Skills and Process
3.  Assessment of Ethics and Attitudes

Pupils will be assessed on their understanding of:

*   Scientific phenomena, facts, concepts and principles
*   Scientific vocabulary, terminology and conventions
*   Scientific instruments and apparatus including techniques and aspects of safety
*   Scientific and technological applications

Applicable for both Sections A &amp; B

*   Read and highlight key words
*   Observe and study given diagram, graph, table, etc
*   Understand the context of the question
*   Know which topic/s &amp;/or concept/s is being tested

Applicable for Section A only

*   Predict answer
*   Read each option carefully
*   Eliminate the unsuitable options
*   Choose best answer
*   Shade answer on OAS carefully and check for transfer error

What if there is more than one option?

*   Read all options carefully
*   Eliminate unsuitable options
*   Check answer especially if there are a combination of options
*   Answer should fit question

Applicable for Section B only

*   Take note of marks awarded
*   A word, a phrase, a sentence or a few sentences
*   Apply the concept to a new situation

Common mistakes in pupils’ answers:

*   Do not read the question carefully
*   Lack an understanding of the question
*   General / vague / incomplete answer
*   Answer is non-scientific
*   Answer is not given in the context of question (Stating general facts or concepts without reference to the question)
*   Answer is too long and includes too many unnecessary details (½ mark will be deducted for each additional incorrect concept / answer)
*   Unable to apply concept to a new situation
*   Unable to link parts of question
