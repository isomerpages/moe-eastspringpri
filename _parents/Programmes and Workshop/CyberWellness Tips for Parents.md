**Cyber Wellness Tips for Parents**

To complement the cyber-wellness curriculum in schools, Here are the steps for **_PARENT_**ing in the digital age:

<u> **_P_**</u>rovide opportunities for a variety of offline activities

*   Spend time with your child by carrying out family activities such as sports and outdoor activities so that your child can lead a healthy and balanced lifestyle.

<u> **_A_**</u>ctivate parental controls in all computing devices

*   Check out the [Guide for Parents on Setting Parental Controls](https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/guide-for-parents-on-setting-parental-controls) and activate them in all computing devices.

<u>**_R_**</u>ole-model good digital habits

*   Manage your own digital habits such as avoiding extensive use of technology and avoiding use of technology during meal times.
*   Show your child safe, responsible and respectful behaviour when sharing, collaborating and creating online.

<u> **_E_**</u>stablish the ground rules for your child’s Internet use

Some basic rules could include the following :

 **Dos:**

*   seek permission before using computing devices
*   have a time limit for the use of electronic devices
*   practice netiquette on the Internet
*   respect intellectual property right
*   follow rules and terms of use of different websites

 **Don'ts:**

*   access websites that have age restrictions (for e.g. many social media sites have age limit for setting up accounts to comply with international regulations on children accessing social media).
*   share password with others
*   share personal information online
*   meet strangers face to face without parents’ knowledge
*   spread rumours and say mean things online

 <u>**_N_**</u>avigate the Internet with your child to understand his/her use 

*   Surf the Internet with your child so that you know what he/she does online and whether he/she is involved in age-appropriate activities. This will help to hone your child’s skills to translate his/her understanding into actions which he/she can later apply should he/she face similar situations.
*   Highlight to your child not to respond to anyone who says something inappropriate and he/she should immediately leave any site if he/she feels uncomfortable.

<u>**_T_**</u>alk with your child about his/her Internet use

*   Get your child to share with you his/her favourite online websites, things he/she do online and what is cool amongst his/her friends.
*   Talk to him/her about his/her online experiences. (For example, discuss about the benefits and risks of the Internet, share how people connect and communicate with one another through the Internet).
*   Let your child know that it is alright to ask you questions or talk to you if he/she run into problems with someone online.
