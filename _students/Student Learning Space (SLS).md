<p>SLS is an online learning portal that allows all students to have equal
access to quality curriculum-aligned resources. These resources are available
to all students for major subjects from primary to pre-university level.

encourages learners to be self-directed, and allows them to personalise
their learning according to their needs and interests.</p>
