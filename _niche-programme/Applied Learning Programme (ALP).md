ALP at ESPS is to provide opportunities for all to deepen 21st century competencies and in moulding every student to be Self-directed Learner, Active Contributor, Confident Person and Concerned Citizen. The core objectives of our ALP are to help our students to acquire various ICT skills and computational thinking skills through coding and apply these skills to solve real-world problems.

  

Working in groups, students will be assigned a design challenge where they would need to tap on the acquisition of Digital Literacy and Digital Values to propose their solutions. The design challenge is based on the existing 3R recycling (eg. Food waste management and rain water recycling) and VIA (eg. Neighbourhood outreach to contribute to the community) programmes which the school is embarking.

  

At different junctures of the ALP lessons, the students will be learning productivity and collaborative tools, coding and cyber wellness values while embarking on design challenge. These tools and skills learnt would sharpen and deepen ICT practices to prepare our students to navigate, curate and connect to the digital world.
