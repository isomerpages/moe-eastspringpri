#### Learning for Life Programme – SPRING for Life <br>
The programme integrates the school’s sports programme and the Outdoor Education components of Navigation, Climbing and Water Confidence to imbue school values and build character for E’Lights. It allows E’Lights to develop their 21st Century Competencies while putting knowledge and skills into action in a progressive manner. More importantly, it serves to cultivate a lifetime of active and healthy living within our students.
