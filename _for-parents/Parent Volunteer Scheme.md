<p>The Parent Volunteer scheme allows parents to register their children
in <strong>Phase 2B</strong> during Primary 1 Registration Exercise.</p>
<p>This applies for a child whose parent has joined primary school as a parent
volunteer not later than <strong>1 July of the year before P1 registration</strong> and
has given at least 40 hours of voluntary service. For example, for a parent
whose child will be in Primary 1 in Year 2027, she/he will register during
P1 Registration Exercise in 2026. &nbsp;She/He will sign up as a Parent
Volunteer with the school not later than 1 July 2025. Please see the diagram
