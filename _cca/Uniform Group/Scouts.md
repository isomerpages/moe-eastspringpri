Scouts emphasises on developing every student as a unique individual by providing them with opportunities to become responsible and compassionate citizens in Singapore. The CCA also strives to inculcate strength in character and nurture independent learners. The students are exposed to a variety of activities that focus on skills and survival techniques. Some of the examples are map reading, knotting, outdoor cooking, camping and community involvement projects which allow them to have an opportunity to make a positive impact by helping others.
