<p>Scouts emphasises on developing every student as a unique individual by
providing them with opportunities to become responsible and compassionate
citizens in Singapore. The CCA also strives to inculcate strength in character
and nurture independent learners. The students are exposed to a variety
of activities that focus on skills and survival techniques. Some of the
examples are map reading, knotting, outdoor cooking, camping and community
involvement projects which allow them to have an opportunity to make a
positive impact by helping others.</p>
