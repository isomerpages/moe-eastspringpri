The Art Club is set up to develop students who possess strong interest in Art and demonstrate skills in this area. Over the years, the club has provided opportunities for the students to hone their skills and participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. Through the club activities, students have grown in confidence, developed an appreciation not only for art, but also built teamwork among themselves.
