*   To provide students with the opportunities to learn various technical aspects of handling AV equipment and their functions.
*   To develop studentsâ€™ leadership skills and empower them to take charge and be in the forefront of capturing school events and other activities.
*   To seek opportunities for students to apply their skills and showcase their talents.
