The Science &amp; Technology club aims to stimulate interest in science activities among the pupils and enable them to carry out self-directed activities in areas of interest in science. Over the years, the club has conducted various interesting modules such as Little Bright Sparks, Young Investigators and Environmental modules. We also provide opportunities for the pupils to develop initiative and foster creativity by encouraging the pupils to participate actively in many competitions such as the SONY Creative Science Award (SCSA) Competition, SHELL Science Fair etc. Through the four years of participating the SCSA, the school managed to clinch several awards in the ScizKid Category.
