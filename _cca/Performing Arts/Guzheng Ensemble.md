The Guzheng Ensemble was set up in 2001. It is our aim to instil in our members, a love for Guzheng, perseverance, self-discipline and an awareness of teamwork. As such, we provide opportunities for students to learn Guzheng and to showcase their talents in both school and public performances.  
  
Our instructor has a wealth of experience in coaching young children. Our students are definitely growing and have developed a passion for Guzheng.
