Indian Dance was first started in 2001. The objective is to provide a platform for students to showcase their talents. From a small number, the group size has increased over the years. Today, the Indian Dance group is made up of boys and girls from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Members have been participating in the Singapore Youth Festival and have developed a passion for Indian Dance. From the Bharatha Natyam to Bollywood to Folk Dance, the Indian Dance Group not only awed the school but also the public during their external performances.
