The Malay Dance Club was set up since the founding of the school. The objective of the club is to provide an opportunity for students to develop their aesthetic skills. The Club also aims to provide students with an avenue to learn more about the Malay culture through dance. The Malay Dance also instils discipline and a sense of responsibility in the students. Members also have the opportunity to compete at the Singapore Youth Festival.
