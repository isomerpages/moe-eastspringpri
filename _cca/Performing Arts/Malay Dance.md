<p>The Malay Dance Club was set up since the founding of the school. The
objective of the club is to provide an opportunity for students to develop
their aesthetic skills. The Club also aims to provide students with an
avenue to learn more about the Malay culture through dance. The Malay Dance
also instils discipline and a sense of responsibility in the students.
Members also have the opportunity to compete at the Singapore Youth Festival.</p>
