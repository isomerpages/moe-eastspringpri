<p>Through participation in Chinese Dance CCA, we hope that students develop
leadership skills and acquire positive values such as perseverance, self-discipline
and commitment. The students will also learn to appreciate the basic and
finer gracious movements of Chinese Dance. Students are taught the fundamental
skills of Chinese Dance and are given opportunities to perform in school
functions. The dance instructress teaches our group of young dancers with
zest and enthusiasm. Through the systematic training, students develop
grace, agility, flexibility, balance and co-ordination.
