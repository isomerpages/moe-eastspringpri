<p>• Mobile Learning with iPADs</p>
<p>iPADs are not just a cool toy but rather a powerful tool that is virtually
changing the face of education. With more than 15 000 education apps available,
teachers and students alike are having no trouble finding content and material
for learning. In East Spring, our students will be involved in Learning
Trails around the school compound. Outdoor learning is now made more fun

There is no better way to draw, paint or just simply doodle with the tablets.</p>
