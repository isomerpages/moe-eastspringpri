2019 marks the 20&nbsp;th&nbsp;anniversary of East Spring Primary School. Our celebration theme is “Together We Shine”, and we hope that our students will continue to shine despite challenges and adversities, and strike for excellence in whatever they do. To commemorate the school’s 20 years of growth, there is a series of celebratory events and a special edition of the School Newsletter to document this milestone. The events center on the non-academic aspects of the school curriculum to allow the students to be holistic and nurture their talents in the aesthetics and physical areas.

We look forward to your continued support and participation in our 20&nbsp;th&nbsp;Anniversary Celebrations. Thank you.  

The video showcases our heritage and how the school has evolved over the last 20 years. It also captures the celebratory events for ESPS's 20th Anniversary.
