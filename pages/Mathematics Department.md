Our Programmes
--------------

*   **Mathematics Amazing Week**

Fun activities and competitions are organized to engage our students to ignite the joy and foster love in the learning of Mathematics. Students apply the Mathematical concepts and knowledge that they have learned and see the relevance of the subject in their daily lives.&nbsp;

  

The theme for 2022 is ‘The Great Escape’, similar to the concept of escape room game. From Math Trails around the school, inter/intra-class Sudoku Challenge to online Deck.Toys lesson adventures, the students were excited to complete every mission in order to obtain clues to help them ‘escape’.
