<h4><strong>Student Management &amp; Discipline</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Discipline Objective (Our Discipline Policy)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At East Spring Primary School,<strong> </strong>our aim is to develop
our students into individuals with good self-discipline so that they can
create a conducive learning environment for them and their peers. <strong>We believe that students learn well when there is order and discipline</strong>.
At the same time, we believe that students need care, encouragement and
space to learn from their mistakes and make improvements in their conduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In line with our plans to move towards positive education, we follow MOE's
guidelines closely towards a more positive and proactive approach to discipline.</p>

</div>
<p>We strongly believe in the importance of the home-school partnership and
working closely and collaboratively with parents and guardians in order
to achieve the best outcomes for our students. We maintain close communication
and proactively engage parents and guardians regarding any inappropriate
behaviour for them to understand the situation better so that we can work
together to guide and support our students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We take a whole-school approach to discipline and articulate explicitly
to our students the school rules and expectations at the start of every
academic year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The discipline policy stated above serves as a guide. Every case is unique
and bound by different circumstances. The school will take the necessary
action(s) in the best interest of our students, school staff and the community.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Restorative Practices</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Discipline is an educative process, and our goal is to instill self-discipline and good character in our students, strengthened by our SPRING values. </strong>Our
disciplinary measures help our students learn the consequences of their
inappropriate actions and to take responsibility for the poor choices made.
Thus, it is important for the consequences to be meted out fairly, firmly,
and appropriately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At East Spring Primary School, we believe in the importance of restoring
relationships among our students through restorative practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for us to achieve this, the Discipline Team works closely with
the Form Teachers and Year Heads using these three steps:
